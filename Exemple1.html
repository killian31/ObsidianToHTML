<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>| Consensus algorithm | Platforms | Description | Requires cryptocurrency | Benefits | Drawbacks |
| :--- | :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| [[#Proof of Work]] (PoW) | Bitcoin | A node (miner) use energy to solve a problem and add a block. User receive crypto for it. | Yes | Most secure consensus algorithm | Needs a lot of computational power. Consume a lot of energy. Risk of centralisation |
| [[#Proof of Stake]] (PoS) | Ethereum, Cardano | | | Better decentralisation.| The richest are likely to become richer.|</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Due to the high network delay in the peer-to-peer network, the order of transactions observed by each node may not be exactly the same. Therefore, the blockchain system needs to design a mechanism to agree on the order of transactions that occur within a similar period of time. This algorithm for agreeing on the order of transactions within a time window is called a "consensus mechanism." </p>

<h1>Proof of Work</h1>
<ul>
<li>Some people (nodes) are competing to solve a problem mathematical problem</li>
<li>The first one to solve it have the right to add the bloc to the blockchain and earn crypto for it (that's the mining process)</li>
<li>The more energy spent, the greater the reward </li>
</ul>
<h1>Proof of Stake</h1>
<ul>
<li>Needs less energy than [[#Proof of Work]]</li>
<li>Validators need to have at stake some crypto that they can't use </li>
<li>Validators are chosen randomly, gathered randomly in groups </li>
<li>Each time a bloc is added, a certain amount of groups need to validate it.</li>
<li>Reward for adding or attesting a bloc is valid</li>
<li>A validator cheating will lose part of his stake </li>
</ul>
<h1>Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)</h1>
<ul>
<li>Performance improve but less decentralised</li>
<li>Voters vote to elect delegates who will validate blocks on voters' behalf</li>
</ul>
<h1>Proof of Authority (PoA)</h1>
<ul>
<li>Blocks approved by validators</li>
<li>Fully automated</li>
<li>To become a validator, a network user must earn the right by accumulating a sufficiently positive reputation</li>
<li>Validators are motivated to uphold the transaction process, as failing to do so would result in a negative reputation being attached to their identities</li>
</ul>
<p>To be established as validator, the following conditions must be met:
1. Identity is verified on the blockchain
2. It has to be difficult to earn this title in order for the community to value this position (for example a validator has to obtain a public notary license)
3. Checks and procedures for establishing authority must be completely uniform</p>
<p>Scalable but high risk of centralisation (=&gt; not likely to see it on a public blockchain)  </p>
